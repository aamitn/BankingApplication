## Introduction

The Banking System Application provides a simple and interactive platform for users to manage their bank accounts. It includes a web-based frontend for balance checking and money transfers, as well as a socket-based GUI client implemented in Swing.

## Features

- User authentication with MySQL database
- Balance checking and money transfer functionality
- Web-based frontend for easy access
- GUI client using Swing for a user-friendly experience

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- MySQL database for user and account information
- Apache Maven (for compiling from source)

## Installation

### Using Precompiled JAR

1. Download the precompiled JAR file from the [releases](https://github.com/yourusername/banking-system/releases) section.
2. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing the downloaded JAR file.
5. Run the following command to start the application:

   ```shell
   java -jar banking-system.jar `

### Compiling from Source

1.  Clone the repository:

    shellCopy code

    `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/banking-system.git`

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    shellCopy code

    `cd banking-system`

3.  Make sure you have Java and Maven installed on your system.

4.  Open a terminal or command prompt.

5.  Compile the `StartApp.java` file using `javac`:

    shellCopy code

    `javac StartApp.java`

6.  Run the compiled application:

    shellCopy code

    `java StartApp`

Usage
-----

1.  Open a web browser and access the web-based frontend at `http://localhost:8080`.
2.  Use the web interface to log in, check your balance, and perform money transfers.
3.  Alternatively, you can launch the socket-based GUI client from the `StartClient` class. The client allows for an interactive graphical experience with features similar to the web interface.

Web Interface
-------------

The web-based frontend provides easy access to the banking system's features:

-   Log in using your credentials.
-   Check your account balance.
-   Perform money transfers to other accounts.

GUI Client
----------

The socket-based GUI client offers an enhanced user experience with a graphical interface. To launch the GUI client:

1.  Compile and run the `StartApp.java` file as mentioned in the "Compiling from Source" section.
2.  The GUI client will open, allowing you to log in, view your balance, and perform money transfers using a graphical interface implemented in Swing.
